Problem Statement:
Design and implement a serverless application named ListService using AWS infrastructure and Terraform for infrastructure as code. 

Functional Requirements:
 - REST API endpoints for head (first element of a list) and tail (all elements of a list except the first one)
 - request and response should be in JSON format
 - we are using public cloud to deploy the code and expose the APIs
 - program and exceptions should be logged properly
 - IAC using Terraform / Opentofu
 - the strings are coming from a dynamo DB ( the data is already present in the DB)

Non-functional requirements:
 - scalable 
 - available
 - Cost effective ( pay as you go )
 - Performance
 - Security 
 - Observability 

Considerations:
 - RPS > 10 but RPS < 1000
 - solution is effective in single region 
 - apart from default security of services we are not adding anything on the top of the servicess
 - cold start is acceptable
 - This is just a MVP for head and tail functions
